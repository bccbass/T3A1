## Q8: Explain type coercion, using examples from the JavaScript programming language

Type coercion is a process that automatically or implicitly converts the data type of an object into another type. This differs from type conversion in which an objects data type explicitly changed - meaning the catalyst of the conversion is deliberately invoked or enacted. Many times different languages have different sets of rules for when and how data types are coerced. In JavaScript this can be seen in the ways numbers and strings are converted when attempted different mathematical operations. In JavaScript if a string is added to a number the number will be implicitly converted to a string and the values will be concatenated:
```javascript
    console.log(50 + '50')
    // expected result: 5050
    console.log(50 + 'Hello world')
    // expected result: 50Hello world
```
However, if string representation of a number is given to a mathematical operation other than addition JavaScript will automatically convert it to a number and return the result:
```javascript
console.log('5' * '5')
// expected result: 25
console.log('5' ** 2)
// expected result: 25
console.log(25 % '5')
// expected result: 0
```

Another way JavaScript uses type coercion is by converting booleans to a number when they are inserted into mathematical operations with another number. True becomes 1 and false becomes 0:
```javascript
console.log(true + 4)
// expected result: 5
```

However when a boolean is added to a string it will be converted to a string as well:
```javascript
console.log(true + 'hello world')
// expected result: truehello world
```

JavaScript leverages type coercion in conditional statments by making available both the loose equality operater (==) and the strict equality operator (===) when comparing values. The loose equality operator will attempt to coerce the type of both values when comparing them in a good faith effort to try to find equivalency. The strict equality operator will not coerce type, returning a more literal and exact comparison:
```javascript
console.log(5 == '5')
// expected result: true 
console.log(5 === '5')
// expected result: false 
```

Every language may implement type coercion differently making it important to understand any idiosyncacies to avoid unforeseen behavior and much frustration.
