        // In this instance, 'new Array(40)' will evaluate to an array with 40 instances of of 'undefined'. 
    // How it all works:
        // Array.from() will iterate over an array of 40 undefined elements and for each element will evaluate to the index value + the integer 1980

        // This number is then multiplied by the Random float from Math.random()
        // Next, the low range (min) is achieved by adding it to this number, essentially shifiting all values up (min) amaunt
