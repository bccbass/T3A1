## Q10: Explain how arrays can be manipulated in JavaScript, using examples from the JavaScript programming language

Arrays in Javascript are an indexed collection of objects. An array can be heterogeneous and contain any valid JavaScript datatype:

```javascript const arr = [42, true, "Hello", {Name: "Ted", isCat: true}, [1, 2, 3]]```

JavaScript has many different ways to work with and maniuplate arrays including standard 'for' and 'for... of' loops as well as a huge set of array methods built into the Array prototype. 

### Adding/removing from the begining/end of an array:
Push and pop are methods that will add or remove the last element from an array, respectively. In addition to removing the last element Pop will return it's value. 

Conversely, unshift and shift are methods that will add or remove the first element from an array, with shift returning the value of the first element. 

These methods mutate the original array. 

### Concatenation
Arrays can be concatenated using many means including the concat method or more literally using the spread operator. 
```javascript

const arrOne = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const arrTwo = [6, 7, 8]

console.log(arrOne.concat(arrTwo));
// Expected result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

console.log([...arrOne, ...arrTwo]);
// Expected result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

### Loops
Because Arrays are iterable they can be looped over in many different ways, most commonly with a 'for' loop of a 'for... of' loop. For loops are used when there is a set number iterations needed. The for loop has a three part structure: 1. set up index (let i) 2. set up condition/range that the loop will stop running under (i < myArray.length) 3. Action to take after the code block has run, usally an incrementor or decrementor (i++) Most commonly this can be seen with looping over every element of an array:
```js
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Element at myArray index ${i} is ${myArray[i]}`)
}
// expected output: 
// Element at myArray index 0 is 1
// Element at myArray index 1 is 2
// Element at myArray index 2 is 3
// Element at myArray index 3 is 4
// Element at myArray index 4 is 5
``` 

A 'For... of' loop iterates over an array, but instead of working with an index it passes the actually element of each iteration to the code block:
```js
const animalArray = ['Emu', 'Wombat', 'Kangaroo', 'Gallah']
for (const animal of animalArray){
    console.log(`${animal} is an element of the animalArray`)
}

// expected output:
// Emu is an element of the animalArray
// Wombat is an element of the animalArray
// Kangaroo is an element of the animalArray
// Gallah is an element of the animalArray

```
'For... of' loops are particularly useful when working with node collections and the DOM. The queryAll method returns a node list which is array-like, but not an array. Because of this built in array methods like forEach and map will not work, but a 'for... of' or 'for' loop will work. 

### Array Methods:
The Array prototype contains multiple methods that are extermely useful and powerful when working with javascript arrays. Some of the most common array methods are `forEach`, `map`, `filter` and `reduce`. These methods work by chainoing them to an array with dot notation and passing in a callback function to define functionality.


#### forEach: 
This method returns nothing. Its callback paramaters by position are: the array element at current iteration, the current elements index, the array. The callback code block can then use these paramters within its logic. In many cases it can be used much the same way a 'for' or 'for... of' loop would be used.

```js
myArray = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three']
myArray.forEach((element, index) => console.log(`Element at index ${index} is ${element}`))

// expected output:
// Element at index 0 is zero
// Element at index 1 is one
// Element at index 2 is two
// Element at index 3 is three
```

#### map: 
The map method returns a new array. Its callback paramaters by position are: the array element at current iteration, the current elements index, the array. Map returns an array with the result of running the callbacks code block on each element:
```js
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

myArray.map(num => num * 10)

// expected output: [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ]
```

#### filter
The filter methods callback paramaters by position are: the array element at current iteration, the current elements index, the array. Filter returns a new array containing all the arrays elements that evaluated to truthy from the callbacks code block:
```js
const myArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
// find all odd numbers:
myArray.filter(num => num % 2 != 0) 

// expexted output: [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 ]
``` 

#### reduce 
The reduce method is a bit trickier than the previous methods. It returns a single value. It accepts a callback and an optional initial value. The callbacks parameters are an accumulator and the current element. Its goals is to 'reduce' the array to a single value. A very simple implementation can be seen in finding the sum of all elements of an array:
```js
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const initialValue = 0
myArray.reduce((accumulator, element) => {return accumulator + element}, initialValue)

// returns 15
```

#### Manipulating targeted elements with the Splice method:
The splice array method can be used to insert, remove, and alter targeted elements of an array. The method takes from 1 to 3 arguements. Splice alters the original array. The returned value is an array containing any elements removed from the array. The first argument is the insertion point into the array. The second argument (optional) is the number of elements to remove. The third argument (optional) will be inserted into the array. 

```js
const animalArray = ['Emu', 'Wombat', 'Kangaroo', 'Gallah']
const lastTwoAnimals = animalArray.splice(2)
console.log(animalArray)
console.log(lastTwoAnimals)
// expected output:
// [ 'Emu', 'Wombat' ]
// [ 'Kangaroo', 'Gallah' ]
```

```js
const animalArray = ['Emu', 'Wombat', 'Kangaroo', 'Gallah']
const middleTwoAnimals = animalArray.splice(1, 2)
console.log(animalArray)
console.log(middleTwoAnimals)
// expected output:
// [ 'Emu', 'Gallah' ]
// [ 'Wombat', 'Kangaroo' ]
```

```js
const animalArray = ['Emu', 'Wombat', 'Kangaroo', 'Gallah']
const addCockatoo = animalArray.splice(3, 0, 'Cockatoo')
console.log(animalArray)
console.log(addCockatoo)
// expected output:
// [ 'Emu', 'Wombat', 'Kangaroo', 'Cockatoo', 'Gallah' ]
// []
```





There are many different ways to work with and manipulate arrays in JavaScript. Combining different methods and approaches serves to create near limitless possibilities for a developer to access and manipulate arrays and their contents.
