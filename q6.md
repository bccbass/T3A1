Q6: With reference to one of your own projects, evaluate how effective your knowledge and skills were for this project, and suggest changes or improvements for future projects of a similar nature

In reflecting on my Portfolio assignment I can identify areas of strengths, but more importantly knowledge and experience that was lacking to produce the most effective product. This assignment was particularly challengin for me as the first weekend I had to work on it was spent moving from the US to Australia and getting settled. 

In creating the portfolio website I had a decent conceptual grasp of html and css and how they worked togethr. I knew that keeping my code organized would be something to keep an eye on, and did my best to implement css classes to keep my code more concise and DRY. The over all concepts of flexbox were 'clicking' and I was able to use it liberally in my implementation. I had a decent foundation of understanding HTML architecture and different css properties to achieve desired effects. A reasonable grasp of these more granule and practical concepts lent me some amount of confidence in undertaking the project, but also created a blindspot for the big picture conceptualization and projecct planning. 

My biggest shortcoming was that I failed to plan in enough detail. I opted to hand draw wire frames instead of using an industry standard wireframing platform. I did not flesh out my ideas or mock up components with enough detail. I only created a very rough site flow and architecture that was not providing enough stylistic or architectural information before I began coding. All of this meant that instead of simply implementing a pre-determined design with my code I was using my code to design: a true example of putting carts before horses.  

Additionally, by starting to code before having a development design and plan firmly in place, I neglected to follow the directive to design with a mobile first approach. While this wasn't the end of the world, it did make it more difficult to make the site responsive, and undermined my confidence for missing that directive. 

Other areas that I would like to improve on are becoming stronger at understanding and writing semantic HTML to make my code more accessible, clearer and add a level of self documentation. I would also like to become more economical with how I structure my css by modularizing and using classes effectively to make styling more reusable and consistent. 

While the end result of the project was acceptable it was not to the standard I had envisioned. On the last term break I decided to attempt a new portfolio website, but this time implemented a more thorough design and planning approach - *before I began coding.* I implemented fully designed site mockups for all standard views, and took the time to think through and edit how interactive components would work in situ. While not perfect (I'd like to make my html more semantic and my css more modular), I am much happier with the result. My main take aways from the Portfolio project were appreciatig the importance of planning, attention to detail and taking time to fully understand the directions of a given brief.
