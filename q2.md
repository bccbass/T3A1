## Q2: What are the most important aspects of quality software?

There are many elements to consider when defining quality software. They can reasonably be divided into three main sections: functionality, structure and process. Functionality is the value provided to the end user with a clear user interface to supply a product to meet a need such as professional tools, entertainment or solving a problem. Structure is comprised of the actual quality and maintainability of the code. Finally process is the efficiency, effectiveness and business concerns of the creation process, including delivering a final product by a given deadline and within given budgetary contraints.

### Functionality:
The functional success of software can be determined by how usable it is and how much value it provides the targeted end user. It should elegantly solve a problem, enhance or promote productivity and creativity, provide entertainment or any combination of these attributes or more. Quality software should have a clear user interface that lowers barriers to interaction and use; when the software is more complex it should have well written and accessible documentation outlining and explaining all features for the user to master. Great software is written efficiently to reduce any lag or run time deficiencies. It should operate with very few to no bugs which would limit functionality or reduce security for the end users data. Software should be portable across many platforms and operating systems. Accesibility concerns should be taken in to account to accomodated various physical or nuerological conditions that may require reasonable consideration to create a great experience for all users.

### Structure
Structural quality of code relates to the actual code base. A codebase should strive to be easily maintiinable; creating or updating features should be able to be seamlessly integrated into the project. The codebase should be clearly understandable and self documenting; this reduces the amount of time it takes for other developers to learn the project codebase and be effective in its maintenance and development. It should be testable, and the testing suite should be thorough and easily run. Code should be modular to promote maintainability, reusalibility and DRY principles. The codebase should be secure and take care to encapsulate any sensitive system data, pass keys and user information; it also must anticipate security threats by malicious actors and over-engineer its security protocol. Lastly, the codebase should be written to be as performant as possible while taking into consideration the conservation of system resources such as processing and storage. 

### Process  
Quality in the software process is concerned with the actual act of creating the product. Its main rubric for success is delivering a quality product on time and within a proscribed budget. It is also extremely important to ensure that the actual development process is productive, sustainable and repeatable so that in the context of a CI/CD approach developers are able to consistenly deliver a great product without burnout and fatigue. This is important to avoid employee attrition and loss in productivitiy which would negatively affect every measure of quality software mentionted thus far.
