## Q11: Explain how objects can be manipulated in JavaScript, using examples from the JavaScript programming language

There are many ways objects can be created and manipulated in JavaScript. Understanding how to access and manipulate an objects properties coupled with a thourough understanding of Object methods can create an invaluable tool with near limitless capabilities when working with JavaScript objects. 

### Creating a new object:
Objects can be created in a handful of ways. The two most common are Oject constructors or Object literals. Object constructors are a type of factory function that can create a new object with predefined structure. They can include methods as well as take user arguments to assign to values. Note that the `this` keyword must be employed in order to reference the scope of the obect being referenced. 
```js
function createSimpson(name, occupation) {
    this.name = name;
    this.occupation = occupation;
}

const smithers = createSimpson('Wayland Smithers', 'personal assistant')
```

ES6 introduced a shorthand for creating a new object, the Object literal:
```js
const lisa = {
    name: 'Lisa Simpson',
    occupation: 'student'
}
```

### Accessing properties
An objects properties can be accessed by using either dot or bracket notation. It is important to remember that dot notation does not work for variables; for use of variables to access properties bracket notation must be used:
```js
const lisa = {
    name: 'Lisa Simpson',
    occupation: 'student'
}
const keyVariable = 'occupation'

console.log('name: ', lisa.name, 'occupation: ', lisa[keyVariable])
// expected output: 
// name:  Lisa Simpson occupation:  student
```

### Object methods
Two of the most useful Object methods are `Object.keys()` and `Object.values()`. They accept an object as an argument and return an array of that objects keys or values, respectively. These methods can be extremely powerful when combined with standard loops or array methods such as map, filter, forEach or reduce.
```js
const scoreCard = {
    gameOne: 10,
    gameTwo: 20,
    gameThree: 30
}

const totalPointsScored = Object.values(scoreCard).reduce((a, b) => a + b)
const subtractFivePoints = Object.keys(scoreCard).map(key => scoreCard[key] -= 5)
```

Objects can also have their properties 'frozen' and protectect from further manipulation. The `Object.freeze()` method protects both keys and values of an object, where `Object.seal()` protects keys but values are still able to be altered.


### Rest operator with objects
An objects contents can be 'unpacked' using the es6 `spread` operator. It works very similarly to using the spread operator with an array:
```js
const scoreCard = {
    gameOneScore: 10,
    gameTwoScore: 20,
    gameThreeScore: 30
}
const winners = {
    gameOneWinner: 'Red',
    gameTwoWinner: 'Blue',
    gameThreeWinner: 'Red'
}

const allGameStats = { ...scoreCard, ...winners}
console.log(allGameStats)
//  expected output:
// {
//   gameOneScore: 10,
//   gameTwoScore: 20,
//   gameThreeScore: 30,
//   gameOneWinner: 'Red',
//   gameTwoWinner: 'Blue',
//   gameThreeWinner: 'Red'
// }
```  

### The for in loop
The for in loop is used to iterate over objects, visiting each object key on every iteration. 

```javascript
const myObject = {
    firstKey: 'I am first',
    secondKey: 'I am second',
    thirdKey: 'I am third'
}
for (let key in myObject){
    console.log(key + ': ' + myObject[key])
}
    // expected to log: 
    // firstKey: 'I am first'
    // secondKey: 'I am second'
    // thirdKey: 'I am third'
```



### Destructuring and Creating Key Value pairs quickly:

Two syntactic mechanisms to help work with objects can be found in destructuring and creating objects:

Destructuring allows a dev to easily pull out keys and values from an object and assign them as their own stand alone variables:

```js
const lisa = {
    name: 'Lisa Simpson',
    occupation: 'student'
}
const {name, occupation} = lisa
console.log(name, occupation)
// expected output: Lisa Simpson student
```
Conversely, an object literal can be created by passing in just a variable alone and the key will be the variable name and its value will be the value associated with that variable:
```js
const name = 'Lisa Simpson'
const occupation = 'student'
const lisaObject = { name, occupation }
console.log(lisaObject)
// epxected output: 
// { name: 'Lisa Simpson', occupation: 'student' }
```
