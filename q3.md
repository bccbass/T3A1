## Q3: Outline a standard high level structure for a MERN stack application and explain the components

A standard MERN stack application is a web application that uses the MongoDB, Express, React, Node tech stack. It is comprised of two main sections: frontend and backend. 

### Frontend
The frontend is the interface that is viewed in the browser, providing logical and well defined functionality for the user to interact with the application and its backend assets. It operates on the client side and is built using React, a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. While applications can take many forms a common use case would be social media app where users can create and view posts, add comments and delete and edit assets that they are the 'owners' of. These are known as basic CRUD operations: create, read, edit, delete. 

### Backend
The backend of a MERN stack application is responsible for storing and serving the data that an application requires. It consists of an API built using NodeJS and Express, implementing Mongoose as an ODM to interact with with a MongoDB database. The API is built using NodeJS and Express and stores API endpoints and routes for the frontend to interact with. It is where much of the business logic occurs, including authentication, authorization, all basic CRUD routes and database functionality. It is configured to accept incoming client requests and serve appropriate responses, as well as to gracefully handle all errors and malformed requests. API responses in MERN apps often take the form of json objects that are requested and returned from the MongoDB server.   

*NodeJS*
Because JavaScript was designed to only run in a browser environment it was initially not possible to use as a backend, serverside language. In 2009 NodeJS was released and allowed developers to run JavaScript outside of a browser environment. This enabled asyncnronous server and network applications to be built using JavaScript language in a runtime environment. This allows for an environemnt to configure database connections with MongoDB via Mongoose and the application API using Express.

*Express* 
Express is a lightweight backend framework for node to create RESTful APIs. It is responsible for defining API endpoints and routes to accept incoming network requests and serve valid responses. Both predefined and user defined middlewares can be implemented to create reusable and modular functionality, including for purposes of data santization, authentication and authorization. 

*MongoDB*
The database used in a MERN stack application is MongoDB, a NoSQL document database. It's strengths lie in its flexibility, speed and ease of editing or updating database structures. Mongoose is the ODM generally used to interact with a MongoDB database, providing additional functionality for creating schemas and models in order to better structure and define a database collection. This is especially useful in a noSQL database to keep documents organized and consistent. MongoDB databases can be stored locally, but are typically stored on dedicated cloud servies such has MongoDB Atlas or AWS - these platforms are optimized for database perforamance and provide many options for project scalability. 

### Putting it all together
Using the simplicistic social media example proposed before: The user navigates to the applications web url where the entire react application is requested and served from the application host. This React front end is stored in the browsers local memory in whole and will not need to re-render to access its various views; they're already locally accessible. On loading, the frontend will make a request to the backend API endpoint needed to fetch a list of all posts that are to be displayed on the homepage. The running API recieves this request and executes the logic associated with the requested route. It then makes an async request to the database stored on MongoDB Atlass to retrive the list of requested documents. The API then deserializes it into a native Node/Javascript object and returns a response consisting of a json object containing the requested database documents.The React front recieves this response and a component or components tasked with displaying the posts will take the json object, desseralize it to a native JavaScript object and peform logic to inject its data into JSX objects to be displayed on the web page for the user to view and interact with.
