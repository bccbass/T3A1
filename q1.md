## Q1: Provide an overview and description of a standard source control process for a large project

Source control is one of the most integral parts of developing a large project with a team of developers. It provides tools and protocols for feature development, bug fixes and version tagging that allows a team to modularly develop different sections of a code base without disturbing a working branch, only integrating changes when certain criteria are met and approved. When beginning a large project a central repository is established with the projects source code, assets, documentation, and other related files. Depending on the projects size and needs an indiviual developer will either clone or fork the required repository to begin development. A branching stragety is employed to determine how a developer will work on their tasks atomically, so as not to disturb the working production code base. A typical feature branch flow involves a developer creating a new, descriptively named, feature branch: this allows for code back-up and collaboration without disturbing the main branch. The developer will work on their feature, hotfix or other code, going through the standard stage, commit, push cycles until complete. At this stage a pull request for the branch is submitted and will be reviewed by team mates, commented on and either approved or have revisions requested. Once the pull request is approved the developers branch will be merged into the main branch, with merge conflicts being addressed if necessary. After successful merge the feature branch will be deleted to keep the repository well organized, with optimized performance.
One current development paradigm is to use continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices to continually build, test and deploy code changes. Many times large projects will implement a 'prod' or 'production' repository branch to silo the production code base. CI/CD depends on a robust automated testing framework to ensure quality code will be integrated into the production branch and deployed. 
Well written and properly maintained documentation is crucial for a large project to track features and details of a projects codebase as well as to document production protocols such as branching strategies, code and style guidelines, project workflows, and any other information pertinent to to the projects production practices.
