## Q9: Explain data types, using examples from the JavaScript programming language

Data types are implemented in programming languages to dictate how different types of data may operate within it. They are necessary structures to ensure code can be safely written, following a set of proscribed rules and consistenly deliver expexted behavior. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables can contain any type of data, and be re-assigned to differing types of data. It is also a weakly typed language, allowing for type coercion when possible as a way to execute code without throwing errors. When an incorrect data type is introduced and cannot be resolved through type coercion a type error is thrown, preventing further executinion of the code. 
```js
3 + 'Hello'
// evaluates to 3Hello

3 * 'Hello'
// evaluates to NaN

const hello = 'World!'
Hello()
// Thrws an Error -> Uncaught TypeError: hello is not a function 
```
The addition operator attempts to coerce the Number to a string for concatenation, where the multiplication operator cannot turn the string into a number so returns Not a Number to let us know the operation is not mathematically possible with the given data types. When the `hello` variable is initialized to a string value and then attempted to be called as a function a TypeError is thrown: a string is not callable and it is impossible to coerce and execute this code.


#### Primitive types

**Numbers:** An interesting feature in JavaScript is that all numbers are floats that are stored as 64 bit floating point numbers. This creates the need for a second numberical data type `BigInt` which becomes necessary to safely store numbers greater than 9007199254740991.

**Strings** are an indexed collection of characters with many built-in methods to manipulate and access the data within.

**Booleans** are the foundation of conditional logic in all programming languages, and JavaScript is no different. They are comprised of `true` and `false`. They are closely tied to binary operators `1` and `0`. As such, in javascript booleans evaluate to a number and can be used in mathemetical expressions: true = 1 and false = 0.

```js
true + true
// evaluates to 2
```

**Null and Undefined:** JavaScript also has data types for data that is not there: `undefined` and `null`. While these may seem confusingly similar `null` represents no returned object or value, where `undefined` represents a variable that has not been defined or assigned an initial value. 

#### Non-Primitive types

Objects in JavaScript are considered non-primitive data types and fall to one of three categories: objects, arrays and functions. Objects are non-indexed collections of key/value pairs. Arrays are an indexed collection of values and objects.

Functions in JavaScript are also first-class objects. They are callable objects that contain blocks of code to be executed. They can be assigned to variables and properties, and have properties and methods of their own. Additionally, functions can also be passed to and returned from other functions. 

#### typeof
When in doubt of what data type a given object is, the `typeof` operator can be used to return a string specifying the objects data type. 

#### TypeScript
TypeScript was created as a means to use JavaScript more similarly to strongly typed languages like C+ or Java. It requires all variables to have a predefined data type, including function paramters. It also requires functions to define the expected data type of their return values. Once defined, variables may only contain values of their predefined data type. While TypeScript may be more complicated at the onset it has the benefit of more clearly defined code and a reduction of type errors.
