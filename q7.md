## Q7: Explain control flow, using an example from the JavaScript programming language

Control flow is the order in which a computer program executes its code. JavaScript execute sequentially, line by line from top to bottom. In order to control the flow that a program executes conditional logic, loops and functions can be implemented. Additionally, javacript can be written asynchronously to further control flow and change the order in which code blocks are executed. 

### Conditional Logic:  
The backbone of JavaScript conditional logic is the Boolean. A Boolean is either True or False, and combined with conditional logic it is possible to create more complex, dynamic and flexible programs. With these structures we are able to control under which conditions certain blocks of code will be executed, and when. This alters the default control flow of top to bottom execution. JavaScript supplies mulitple mechanisms for conditional logic including if, else if and else statments, ternary operators and shortciruit logic. The core of these statements is 'if an input evaluates to <true>, run this particular code block'. A few simple examples: 

```javaascript
if (thisCondition === true) {
    console.log("The IF statement codeblock ran")
}
else if (anotherCondition === true){
     console.log("The ELSE IF statement codeblock ran")
}
else {
    console.log('Neither the if or else if statments were true, so the ELSE statment ran')
}
```
When a statement has exactly two, single expression code blocks to run depending on a condition a ternary expression can be implemented:
```javaascript
thisCondition === true ? 'I return when the condition is true' : 'I return when the condition is false'
```
And when there is only one code block to run if, and only if, a statement is true shortcircuit ternary logic can be implemented:
```javaascript
const shortCircuitTernary = true && "This side of the operand will be the return value if the first condition is true"
```

### Loops:
Loops alter the control flow of a program by executing a block of code a certain number of times, determined by some conditional logic. The most common conditions that determine a loops behavior are a loop will execute until: a condition evaluates to false, a predetermined number of times, or for every item in an array or object. In JavaScript for a loop to run until a condition evaluates to true a while loop is implemented. For a loop to run a predetermined number of times a for loop is most common (and can also be used to iterated over an array and visit all of its items). The for of and for in loops are used to iterate over arrrays and objects respectively, with a for of loop visiting each array item on every iteration, and a for in loop visiting each object key on every iteration. 
```javascript
const myArray = [1, 2, 3]
for (let item of myArray){
    console.log(item)
}
    // expected to log: 
    // 1 
    // 2 
    // 3

```
```javascript
const myObject = {
    firstKey: 'I am first',
    secondKey: 'I am second',
    thirdKey: 'I am third'
}
for (let key in myObject){
    console.log(key + ': ' + myObject[key])
}
    // expected to log: 
    // firstKey: 'I am first'
    // secondKey: 'I am second'
    // thirdKey: 'I am third'
```

JavaScript provides many array methods to loop over arrays and interact with their contents including map, forEach, reduce and filter.

Another mechanism in JavaScript that can be powerful in controlling flow is the Switch statment. Switch statements work by comparing an argument with a number of possible conditional matches or 'cases'. If an argument matches a supplied conditional case then its associated block of code will run. Switch statements 'fall through' so if there is a case match not only will its code block run, but each subsequent cases code block also executes. This cascade behavior can be ameliorated by using a break statement to exit out of the switch statement after running a code block. Additionally a defaul block of code can be supplied and will run if there is no case match. 

The break and continue keywords can be used to further adjust control flow within loops. The break keyword is used in a code block to exit out of the loop and cease all remaianing iterations. The continue keyword can be used to continue to the next iteration of the loop. 

### Functions:

Functions can alter control flow by taking in zero or more arguments and executing a static or dynamic code block which itself can contain loops, conditional logic or even other functions, all altering the overall flow of a program depending on where they are invoked and what arguments are passed in. 

### Asynchronous JavaScript:
One of the most useful and more novel things in JavaScript is it's use of asynchronous behaviour by implementing callbacks, promises and async/await. Because JavaScript is the language of the web there are many tasks that require time to complete such as making making API requests or working with a database. With all of the previously mentioned ways to control flow in JavaScript it still executes top to bottom, and is blocking. This means that if a block of code is taking a long time to complete it will hold up or block all subsequent code from executing. This makese for a terrible user experience in a web based application with all of the user interactions and network requests. However, JavaScripts use of client webAPIs and the event loop can take these asynchronous tasks out of the stack flow, adding them as webAPIs to a holding area. When an asynchronous webAPI is resolved its callback is pushed to the callback qeue to wait. As soon as the stack is clear the event loop pushes the callback onto the stack for it to finally be executed. This allows for smooth operation and a much more pleasing user experience. 

```javascript


function importantCode() {console.log("This is very important, time sensitive code!")}

fetch('http://ourAwesomeAPI.come/endpoint.json')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {console.log(`something important done with: ${data}`)}

importantCode()
```
In the previous example the use of chained promises allows our 'importantCode' function to run and not be blocked by an api request that might take a long time to complete. This allows us to control the flow of our program even further, keeping the code execution running smoothly.
