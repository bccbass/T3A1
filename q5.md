## Q5: With reference to one of your own projects, discuss what knowledge or skills were required to complete your project, and to overcome challenges

When beginning a new project there will be some amount of soft and hard skills needed to produce a successful result. Both categories complement each other and when combined synergistically create a functional production environment. For the Terminal Application project from the first term I relied heavily on many of these newly aquired skills to produce a game of of Yahtzee to be played in the terminal. 

### Soft Skills
Soft skills can be seen as non-technical knowledge or attributes that are necessary to function productively on a team or at a job. 
these are things such as team work, systems thinking and attitude. In reflecting on my experience with the Portfolio Project I tasked myself with leveling up some lacking soft skills that made the project less successful than anticipated; time management, detail oriented understanding of the brief and using proper project management approaches.

- Creativity and understanding of scope to come up with a project idea that is engaging, fullfills the project brief and is possible given the required skill level and time constraints.
- Time management to parse different needs of the project, set deadlines and stick to them in order to comfortably deliver the project in time.
- Perseverence and self-knowledge to handle blockers and obstacles: knowing when to push through to a solution and when to step away for an hour to rest and gain perspective. There were many times when I had to make a call to step away from the project for a few hours, and that perspective gave me the space to solve blockers more effectively.
- Flexibility and adaptability: periodically taking a step back to evaluate the progress and scope of the project. This entails evaluating progress and unforeseen development issues, calculating if they affect the outcome and timing of delivering the project, and finally finding a solution that will still yield a successful delivery of the project within the time constraints. This was helpful when midway through the project I realized that delivering the bottom half of the game board was becoming likely to negatively affect other more important aspects of the project. By leaving it as a stretch feature to implement at a later date I was able to deliver a higher quality project that met the MVP and fulfilled the assigment rubric.

### Hard Skills
Hard skills are more tangible and quantifiable. They include knowledge and proficiency in languages, frameworks and other technologies. The Yahtzee project required me to look at the overall goals of the project and evaluate which hard skills would best be suited to apply toward the project. 
- General grasp of the Python language and broader software development approaches such OOP and functional programming. OOP was hesavily implemented when constructing classes for Dice, Players and Cards. All of these classes implemented setters, methods and properties to create an efficient and well organized code base. 
- Understanding PyTest and Test Driven Development (TDD) concepts: TDD was implemented to craft the logic to discern a players hand and respond with approprate category choices. Tests were written first and the algorithms were written second and then incorporated into a method on the Card class. 
- Functional programming: Used to construct functionality for discerning card hands and stored in the card.py module, imported to be included in class methods on the Card class.
- Error handling: Implementing graceful error handling is paramount in creating seamless software that is enjoyable for a user. One has to become quite creative about all the ways their code could break and anticipate problems by implementing input validation and error handling. 
- Auxiliary languages and tools: including BASH for the scripts, Markdown for the documentation, PIP for importing packackes and creating requirements files, Git/GitHub workflows for source control and working with JSON in the games score log. 

### Overcoming Challenges:
There were many obstacles and roadblocks that occured throughout the projects creation; time management, unanticipated bugs, self-doubt and overly ambitious goals. Persistence and adaptability were the main elements implemented to overcome these various challenges. Taking a step back, re-evaluating approach when necessary, and implementing the previously mentioned hard and soft skills to overcome the obstacles was key in working through these tough times. The process was truly intense all the way until the end - in the 11th hour my entire install script (which had been working for days) met an unforeseen bug, causing me a mild heart attack. This final challenge was met by taking a deep breath, focusing the information I had available to me and getting curious as to what had gone wrong. Thankfully the cause of the but found quickly and the project was successfully submitted.
