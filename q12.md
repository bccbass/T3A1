## Q12: Explain how JSON can be manipulated in JavaScript, using examples from the JavaScript programming language

JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is a data structure based on JavaScript object syntax. Altough JSON closely resembles a JavaScript object it exists as a string and can be used by many different programming languages. Generally for a programming language to use a JSON object it must be deserialized to a native language object. The most common JSON structures in JavaScript resemble either a single object or an array of objects. Once a JSON object is deserialized it may be acted upon, read and manipulated just as a JavaScript object. It is important to note that JSON format requires the object to be wrapped in double quotes. Additionally all keys and strings must be wrapped in double quotes as well for the JSON to work properly. 


JavaScript provides a number of ways to serialize and deserialize JSON objects:
- As part of the Response interface the .json() method will take a response stream and read it to completion, returning a promise that will reolve to a JSON object. 
- The static JSON object which can be used to serialize and deserialize JSON objects. JSON.parse() will deserialize a JSON string and return a javascript object. JSON.stringify() will accept a javascript object and return a JSON string. 

A workflow example of working with JSON from an API in JavaScript: 

```javascript
const quoteWrapper = document.getElementById('quotewrapper');


fetch('https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/quotes?count=5')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
        for (let quote of data) {
            quoteWrapper.innerHTML += `<h2>${quote.quote}</h2><h3>- ${quote.character}</h3> <img src="${quote.image}" alt="" width="30" height="auto"> <hr>`
    }} )
```
Resulting in:

Consider this example of working with a local JSON file in Node. Note that working with a JSON object via an API would be a similar workflow and also require parse and stringify functionality.

```javascript 
import fs from 'fs'
// raw data is read from the quotes.json file
let rawdata = fs.readFileSync('./quotes.json')

// Raw data is deserialized into a JS object
const quote = JSON.parse(rawdata)[0]
console.log('Parsed JSON -> ', quote)


// create episodeInfo object to add to the quote 
const episodeInfo = {
    season: 6
}

// add episode info object to the quote
quote.episodeInfo = episodeInfo

console.log('episodeInfo object added to quote -> ', quote) 

// Add new key/value pair to episodeInfo object on the quote object:
quote.episodeInfo.name = "Bart Of Darkness"

console.log('name added to episodeInfo object of quote -> ', quote) 

// Serialize the upaded quote object and save to variable called data
const data = JSON.stringify(quote, null, 2)

// Write the serialzed JSON object to the original JSON file (overwriting original contents) 
fs.writeFileSync('./quotes.json', data)

```

In this example the File System module is used to first read the JSON file into the node app. This incoming data is then deserialized using the JSON.parse(), returning an array with a single element being a JavaScript object version of the JSON object stored in the file. Then, a new ```episodeInfo``` object is created with one key/value pair for season number. This object is then added to our deserialized JSON object using traditional JS object syntax. A new key/value pair for ```name``` is then added directly to the ```episodeInfo``` object contained within the ```quote``` object. Each stage of the ```quote``` object is console logged:

Finally the quote object is serialized as a JSON object and the original JSON file is rewritten with the updated, serialized quote object:
