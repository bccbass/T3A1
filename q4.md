## Q4: A team is about to engage in a project, developing a website for a small business. What knowledge and skills would they need in order to develop the project?

In order for a team to successfully deliver a production level website for a small business they would need to possess a large combination of both soft and hard skills. Depending on the chosen tech stack, the team would need both frontend and backend skills. One standard approach would be to use a MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS. The team would need to understand the overal all application structure between the front end and backend as well as how data is transfered between the frontend, api and database. They should have a sense of software engineering approaches such as REST and MVC designs. The front end would not only require knowledge of React to create a usable user interface, but would also involve a solid understanind of design and UI/UX concepts, accesiblity in code with implementations of semantic html, single page application behavior and the ways they simulate routing via url addresses. Backend skills would included understanding routers and routing in express, connecting an express framework to a database, implementing Mongoose as an ODM to interface with MongoDB, implementing mongoose schemas and models as well as broader database design concepts. 
The team would need to have a thorough understanding of software security best practices to protect the website agains malicious actors, protecting and   business and user data from unauthorized access. Understanding authorization and authentication as well as outside tools for implementations such as bcrypt, jwt tokens and OAuth are also required to site integrity. 
Proper project management tools such as development and source control would be necessary for the teams success. A project management protocol such as Agile would be instrumental in giving the development process structure and providing a framework for planning, tracking and orchestrating development sprints. The team must also understand git and online source control platforms such as GitHub in order to manage and develop a working code base. Knowledge of different source control approaches, such as feature branch or gitflow appraoches, and choosing the best suited approach for the project is also paramount to creating a well functioning project protocol. 
The team must understand deployment for their project to be successfully launched to the public. This involves understanding how to host the front end, backend API as well as the database. Configuring the three majory components to communicate to communicate with eachother over the network, encapsulating any sensitive pass keys and other environment variables as well as optimizing performance on various hosting platforms is also essential to project success. 

Finally, in addition to hard skills, a team is equally dependant on its members soft skills. These are the individual qualities that foster a healthy and productive team that can work harmoniously together to deliver a quality product. These skills include team work, communication, adaptability, flexibility, patience, persistence and maybe a sense of humor to smooth over any minor hard times that might arise. While these qualities are more amorphous and intangible than hard coding skills, they are equally as important to a projects success; they ensure a team can communicate and function smoothly during potentially challenging circumstances, and for extended periods, in order to deliver a quality product.
